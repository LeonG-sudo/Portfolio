### üöÄ Project Overview

- **Goal:** Build a relational database to manage and analyze student-loan clients.
- **Data Sources:**  
  - `Clients.xlsx` (loan records)  
  - Pre-provided `Colleges` table
  - Not real numbers in this Portfilio (All Names and Numbers Are Made Up)

### üíº My Responsibilities

1. **Data Import & Schema Design**  
   - Imported `Clients.xlsx` into an Access table; set `ClientID` as PK  
   - Adjusted field properties (data types, sizes, formats) for data integrity  

2. **Data Modeling**  
   - Established one-to-many relationship between `Clients` and `Colleges`  
   - Enforced referential integrity with cascade update/delete  

3. **Query Development**  
   - **2019 Graduates**: Filtered expected‚Äêgraduation = 2019; selected key client/contact fields  
   - **Loan Payments**: Used `Pmt()` to calculate 10-year, 5% monthly payments; formatted as currency; summarized averages  
   - **Loan Summary by College**: Count of loans and average loan amount per college  

4. **Form & Report Design**  
   - Built a **Split Form** for streamlined data entry; reordered fields; updated sample records  
   - Designed **Client Loans** report (landscape, grouped by graduation year, Integral theme) for executive print distribution  

5. **Presentation & Documentation**  
   - Provided screenshots and step-by-step instructions in project deliverables  
   - Documented all table modifications, query logic, and report formatting
